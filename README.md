A living ecosystem.
This project represents a simulation of an ecosystem with animal types - carnivores and herbivores.
Carnivores are able to attack herbivore, however, there is an attack chance/success rate which is calculated based on the carnivore's attack points and herbivore's escape points. An attack may be successful or unsuccessful.
